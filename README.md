# Text to Speech using Amazon Polly

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works
Enter text input, or a file and hit Convert. You would receive a downloadable link for an audio file narrating your input. There is an option to choose different voice styles.
